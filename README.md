## Description
*  I have created a code for analyzing the financial records of a company base on the financial dataset provided. The dataset is composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses. 
My task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The total change in profits from month to month and then find the average change.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
